# Portfolio — Frank Evbota

A custom product design portfolio website for **Frank Evbota** built with
semantic HTML, CSS3, and JavaScript, featuring responsive layouts, smooth
animations, and detailed case studies.

No build step, no framework, no dependencies — the site is static files served
as-is.

## Layout Rhythm

Page-level spacing and fill live in a single override layer at the end of
`brand.css`, marked `/* RHYTHM LAYER */`. Every direct child of `<main>`
carries a `fe-rhythm` marker class, and the layer resolves the section rhythm.

| Breakpoint | Page margin | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `≤ 600px` | `16px` | Mobile; `360px` is the supported floor |
| `601–960px` | `32px` | Tablet |
| `≥ 961px` | `160px` | Desktop (footer overridden to `80px`) |

---

## Accessibility

- Exactly one `<h1>` per page; no skipped heading levels.
- All text meets WCAG 2.1 AA contrast.
- Interactive targets are ≥ `32px`; visible `:focus-visible` outlines.
- Every image has `alt`; every form control has a `<label for>`.
- `prefers-reduced-motion` honoured in CSS and JS.

---

## Local Development

Serve the directory over HTTP (port `8765` is used by the QA scripts):

```bash
python -m http.server 8765 --bind 127.0.0.1
```

Then open <http://127.0.0.1:8765/>.

Do not open a dev server on ports `20129`, `20128`, `8080`, or `8081`.

---

## Verification

QA scripts live in `output/qa/` (gitignored) and are run against the local
server. See `STYLE-GUIDE.md` §7 for the full list and what each script checks.
